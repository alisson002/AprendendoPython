0
1
2
3
4
Done!

#Exercise 11: Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range
Note: A Prime Number is a number that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers

Examples:

6 is not a prime mumber because it can be made by 2×3 = 6
37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.
Given:

# range
start = 25
end = 50
Expected output:

Prime numbers between 25 and 50 are:
29
31
37

Python if else, for loop, and range() Exercises with Solutions
Updated on: September 6, 2021 | 246 Comments

To decide and control the flow of a program, we have branching and looping techniques in Python. A good understanding of loops and if-else statements is necessary to write efficient programs in Python.

This Python loop exercise aims to help Python developers to learn and practice if-else conditions, for loop, range() function, and while loop.

Use the following tutorials to solve this exercise

Control flow statements: Use the if-else statements in Python for conditional decision-making
for loop: To iterate over a sequence of elements such as list, string.
range() function: Using a for loop with range(), we can repeat an action a specific number of times
while loop: To repeat a block of code repeatedly, as long as the condition is true.
Break and Continue: To alter the loop’s execution in a certain manner.
Nested loop: loop inside a loop is known as a nested loop
